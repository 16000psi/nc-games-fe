NC GAMES

This website is part of a full stack project which aims to create a pretend board games review site, featuring reviews, accounts and comments.  This is the front end component, which is written using React.  Users can search for reviews, add comments, view reviews by category, log in and out, and vote on reviews. 

There is a menu bar at the top which you can use to navigate through the website.  Individual reviews can be viewed either on their own or as expanding cards along with other results.  You can log in via the users menu which will allow you to add comments as well as delete your previous comments.  

The backend is hosted here: https://nc-games-dave.onrender.com/api and its repo is here: https://github.com/16000psi/Boardgame_API

This frontend was written in React 18.2 with JS Node, version 19.1. 

In order to run this frontend on your own machine, clone this repo and then run npm install in the root directory.  Run npm start to see the app working.

It uses the packages: React-router-dom, framer-motion, axios, react-DOM. //
